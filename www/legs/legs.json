Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.",

Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg. Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg.

Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. Tip: You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.",
