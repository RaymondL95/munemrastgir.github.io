<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>

    <div class="column1">
    <p> Hello we are team Fitness-Web. We are students are Hunter College. This is our project for our Capstone course. Our team consists of four people. Raymond, Chris, Munem, and Shi Li. We are all fitness enthusiasts that wish to inform others that are interested in fitness. We had many questions starting our journey in fitness. What should I eat? How much protein should I take. Am I doing this exercise right? These are some questions that many, including us have asked. We created this website with super condensed material with the aim of providing essential information, just for you! We are by no means experts, however we can help answer some questions you might have.</p>
